# Travel-Guide-for-Western-Macedonia

Design and development of an Android Application for touristic content, along with a Supportive Website, focused on Western Macedonia. This application and website were created to facilitate the search of touristic information, as also the navigation at various points of interest. 
More specifically, through a user-friendly graphical environment and with the help of the Google Maps API platform, the user can easily, quickly and directly store a place or a tour on the website. By saving it, it is immediately available in the Mobile Application. When the user starts the application, the current location is located and the user can be easily navigated in one of the saved areas or tours. 
System administrators have the same capabilities as simple users but additionally, they can process or delete users, view, edit and delete all of the saved areas and tours, and make another user an admin.
